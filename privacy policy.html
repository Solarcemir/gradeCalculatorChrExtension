  <h1>Grade Calculator Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Last updated: May 09, 2025</p>
  <p>The Grade Calculator Chrome extension is designed to help students manage and calculate their course grades. We are committed to protecting your privacy, and this policy outlines how we handle your data.</p>
  <h2>Data Collection</h2>
  <p>The Grade Calculator extension <strong>does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data</strong>. All information you enter, such as course names, weights, and grades, is stored locally on your device using Chrome's storage API (<code>chrome.storage.local</code>). This data is not shared with us or any third parties.</p>
  <h2>Data Usage</h2>
  <p>The data you input is used solely to perform grade calculations within the extension and to persist your entries between sessions. We do not use this data for any other purpose, nor do we transfer it to third parties.</p>
  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>This extension does not use any third-party services that collect data. All functionality, including grade calculations and theme toggling, is performed locally within the extension.</p>
  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>Since all data is stored locally on your device, the security of your data depends on the security of your device and browser. We recommend keeping your browser up to date to ensure the best protection.</p>
  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated "Last updated" date.</p>
  <h2>Contact Us</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions about this privacy policy, you can contact us at: <a href="mailto:lhoifan@uoguelph.ca">lhoifan@uoguelph.ca</a>.</p>
